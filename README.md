Started out as a small project over the break and has spiraled out of control over time. 

![Latest render](/render.bmp)

## Currently implements:
* basic path tracing on gpu using CUDA or optionally using CPU
* handles large .obj / .mtl scenes
* rendering to .bmp image
* BVH construction on CPU with surface area heuristic

## TODO:
* materials (already in .mtl file but not used)
* importance sampling
